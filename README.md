# threaded

Minimalist Thread Pool in Rust

Glanceable source code for prototypes seeking brevity with transparency.

## Stability

Experimental

Threaded is not fully covered nor benched let alone comparatively performance tested.

## Branching Strategy

[Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)

## Usage

See [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/threaded/0.2.0/threaded/).

```rust
use threaded::ThreadPool;

// start thread pool with fixed capacity of 2 workers (single producer, multiple consumer; spmc)
let tp = ThreadPool::new(2);

tp.execute(|| println!("hello threaded!")); // execute function in pool

let _num_workers = tp.capacity(); // get capacity of pool

// once tp goes out of scope, drop is called
// drop joins worker threads subsequently blocking main thread until workers finish

drop(tp); // manually trigger drop and join threads
```

## Credits

The [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) details integral features needed to begin writing useful programs while adhering to community guidelines. Threaded was based directly off the book's final project ["Building a Multithreaded Web Server"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html).
