# threaded

Minimalist Thread Pool in Rust

Glanceable source code for prototypes seeking brevity with transparency.

**Stability:** Experimental

Threaded is not fully covered nor benched let alone comparatively performance tested.

**Branching Strategy:** [Trunk Based Development](https://trunkbaseddevelopment.com/)

## Usage

**Create a fixed capacity thread pool.**

```rust
use threaded::ThreadPool;

// start thread pool with size of 2 workers
let tp = ThreadPool::new(2);

// do something useful w/pool...

// once tp goes out of scope, drop is called
// drop joins worker threads subsequently blocking main thread until workers finish
```

**Single producer, multiple consumer (spmc) thread pool with single function/closure execution.**

```rust
tp.execute(|| println!("hello threaded!"));
```

## Credits

The [Rust Programming Language Book](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/) details integral features needed to begin writing useful programs while adhering to community guidelines. Threaded was based directly off the book's final project ["Building a Multithreaded Web Server"](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/ch20-00-final-project-a-web-server.html).
